Water Meter is a prototype app built with Vue.js, VueX, and Vue Router. It was created for a friend taking the "Entrepreneurship: Ideation to Creation" class as part of the University of Denver's Professional MBA program. This project is meant to simulate what it would be like using a mobile app with a conceptual Internet of Things water meter. You can add up to 6 devices and see static usage data for each device.
