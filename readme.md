# Listify

Listify converts text lists into HTML lists.

I often needed to convert text documents into HTML at one of my previous jobs. There was an online tool called "Listify" that would make the process of converting lists into HTML much faster than doing it manually. I decided to recreate it using JavaScript after learning that it is no longer available online.
